# DiscordPPReBot

Simple discord bot that essentially implements 
the [osu-tools](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools) PerformanceCalculator
with currently Xexxar's currently [newest implementation](https://github.com/emu1337/osu/tree/xexxar-final).

## Run

Simply set the environment variables `API_KEY` to your [osu api key](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api)
and `DISCORD_TOKEN` to the [discord token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) of your bot.
Then add it to your server, and check osu profiles with a discord message `!profile <username / user id>`.
